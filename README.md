# castaway_problem

This project is on finding a solution for the castaway on an island of radius 1 units to escape from the island without getting eaten by the shark that can be on the boundary of the island.

Download solution.m and find_direction.m files. 

Run solution.m file which has find_firection.m function. An animation of the solution is diplayed.

For the initial positions of castaway and shark intersecting, there is no solution. For any othe case, there is a definite solution.
